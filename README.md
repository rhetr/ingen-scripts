# ingen-scripts

scripts for ingen

**ingen.mdo** - creates left and right output ports, sticks a limiter onto them and then connects to system playback

**ingen.ld** - ingen -e + ingen.mdo

**ingen.mt** - create a "track"

**ingen.place** - drag and drop an lv2 URI here to make it show up in ingen. this is really just a hack to use with [surplus](http://github.com/rhetr/surplus)
